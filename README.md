# prescience-r
R package of the Approximate Best Subset Maximum Binary Prediction Rule (PRESCIENCE) proposed by Chen and Lee (2018).

Description of this prediction method and its computation details can be found in the paper:
Chen, Le-Yu and Lee, Sokbae (2018), "Best Subset Binary Prediction".

The above paper and the Matlab implementation of PRESCIENCE can be found at https://github.com/LeyuChen/Best-Subset-Binary-Prediction.

Note: the codes in this R package are developed based on the above Matlab codes by Le-Yu Chen
